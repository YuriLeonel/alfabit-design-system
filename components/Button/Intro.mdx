# Button

The Button is a molecule used to trigger actions. It supports all native attributes via `React.ButtonHTMLAttributes`, and can be themed through `className`.

## Accessibility

- Ensure the button text clearly describes the action
- Disabled state should be visually distinct and keyboard focusable elements must remain accessible around it

## Usage

<Primary />

## Variants


### Violet
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Violet} />

### Disabled
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

## Props

<Controls />
