# Organisms

Organisms are composites of molecules and atoms that form distinct sections, such as headers, footers, and content sections.

Guidelines

- Encapsulate layout and behavior for a section
- Keep APIs cohesive; expose only necessary props
- Remain responsive and accessible across breakpoints
